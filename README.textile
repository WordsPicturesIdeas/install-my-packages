install-my-packages is WPI's common set of tools to get a clean server up and running like we like it.


h2. Setup

@install-my-packages@ should work with any recent release of CentOS

h3. The automatic installer... (do you trust us?)

You can install this via the command line with `curl` as root.

h4. via `curl`

@ curl -L https://github.com/WordsPicturesIdeas/install-my-packages/raw/master/install-my-packages.sh | sh@

The more secure option is to not blindly run any foriegn code. In that case, run:

@ curl -L https://github.com/WordsPicturesIdeas/install-my-packages/raw/master/install-my-packages.sh > install-my-packages.sh @

Then audit the code and run it as you see fit.
