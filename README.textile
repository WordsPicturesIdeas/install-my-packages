@install-my-packages@ is a common set of tools to get a new server up and running. 
There are resources for both CentOS and Debian distributions.


h2. Setup

h3. The automatic installer... (do you trust us?)

You can install this via the command line with `curl.`

CentOS:
@curl -L https://github.com/turbobrian/install-my-packages/raw/master/install-my-packages-centos.sh | sh@
or, for Debian:
@curl -L https://github.com/turbobrian/install-my-packages/raw/master/install-my-packages-debian.sh | sh@

The more secure option is, CentOS:
@curl -L https://github.com/turbobrian/install-my-packages/raw/master/install-my-packages-centos.sh > install-my-packages.sh@
or for Debian:
@curl -L https://github.com/turbobrian/install-my-packages/raw/master/install-my-packages-debian.sh > install-my-packages.sh@
